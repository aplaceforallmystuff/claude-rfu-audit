<current_state>
Phase 5 planning is COMPLETE. Research done, 2 plans created and verified.
Ready to execute - no work has started on implementation yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- 05-RESEARCH.md: Created (778 lines) - comprehensive research on LLM extraction patterns, README heuristics, human-in-the-loop verification workflows, confidence scoring
- 05-01-PLAN.md: Created - defines AUTO-ANALYZE.md guide creation (2 tasks)
- 05-02-PLAN.md: Created - defines SKILL.md integration (3 tasks)
- Plan verification: PASSED - all 5 success criteria covered
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Plan 05-01: Create AUTO-ANALYZE.md guide
- Task 1: Create guide with extraction template and field definitions (7 fields mapped to gates)
- Task 2: Add human verification workflow, conflict handling, pitfalls, and limitations

## Plan 05-02: Add --auto-analyze to SKILL.md
- Task 1: Add --auto-analyze flag to Usage and Mode Selection (4 mode combinations)
- Task 2: Add extraction step to Process section with field-to-gate mapping
- Task 3: Add AUTO-ANALYZE.md reference and graceful degradation documentation
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Extraction is hypothesis generation**: Present as "Claude suggests..." not "Claude determined..."
- **Confidence levels**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/UNCERTAIN with visual indicators (checkmark/warning/question)
- **Human verification required**: Approve/edit/reject workflow before gate scoring
- **Combinable flags**: --auto-analyze works with --quick (4 mode combinations total)
- **Graceful degradation**: Extraction failures degrade to manual entry, never block audit
- **Fields mapped to gates**: 7 fields extracted (project_name, one_line_description, value_proposition, target_users, key_features, installation_time_estimate, prerequisites)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None.

<context>
Phase 5 adds auto-analyze mode to reduce manual data entry friction. The key insight from research is that extraction is hypothesis generation - we're providing suggestions for human verification, not automated scoring.

The implementation creates:
1. `skill/guides/AUTO-ANALYZE.md` - Guide documenting extraction heuristics, confidence scoring, verification workflow
2. Updates to `skill/SKILL.md` - Adds --auto-analyze flag, mode detection, extraction step in process

Both plans are in wave 1 (parallel execution). The guide and SKILL.md touch different files so can be built simultaneously.

Key design patterns from research:
- Structured extraction prompts with JSON output
- Confidence-based presentation (HIGH = approved default, MEDIUM = needs review, LOW = rejected default)
- Source attribution for every extraction
- Conflict detection (README vs package.json)
- Installation time conservative estimates

<next_action>
Run: `/gsd:execute-phase 5`

This will spawn parallel executors for both plans. Expected outputs:
- `skill/guides/AUTO-ANALYZE.md` (new file)
- `skill/SKILL.md` (modified with --auto-analyze support)

After execution, verify and update ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md.
