<objective>
Create the gates-quick.md configuration file defining the 5-gate quick audit subset.

Purpose: Quick mode needs its own gate configuration that references (not duplicates) the full gate specs. This file defines which gates to run, why they were selected, how to evaluate them quickly, and the triage decision algorithm.

Output: `skill/config/gates-quick.md` with reference-based gate definitions and triage logic.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create gates-quick.md with 5-gate subset</name>
  <files>skill/config/gates-quick.md</files>
  <action>
Create a new file `skill/config/gates-quick.md` with the 5-gate quick audit subset.

**Structure the file as follows:**

1. **Header and purpose statement:**
   - Title: "RFU Audit: Quick Mode Gate Definitions"
   - Clear statement that this is a 5-gate subset for rapid triage
   - Explicit note: "For complete gate specifications, see config/gates-full.md"

2. **Quick Mode Overview section:**
   - Table showing 5 gates with Core Question and Stop Condition:
     | Gate | Core Question | Stop Condition |
     |------|---------------|----------------|
     | 1 | Why does this exist? | No bedrock human need |
     | 3 | Can users get value in 10 minutes? | Inaccessible or unclear |
     | 4 | Can you explain it in one sentence? | Unexplainable = unusable |
     | 5 | Would anyone pay for this? | No market validation |
     | 9 | Is this the simplest solution? | Simpler alternative exists |

   - Time target: "5-10 minutes total (1-2 minutes per gate)"
   - Gate selection rationale: These gates form the critical path (Why -> Accessible -> Explainable -> Marketable -> Necessary)

3. **Triage Decision Algorithm section:**
   | Score | Verdict | Recommendation |
   |-------|---------|----------------|
   | 5/5 | PROCEED | Run full 11-gate audit |
   | 4/5 | PROMISING | Fix 1 issue, then consider full audit |
   | 3/5 | BORDERLINE | Fix 2 issues before full audit |
   | 0-2/5 | STOP | Fundamental issues; fix before audit |

   Include next steps text for each threshold level.

4. **For each of the 5 gates (1, 3, 4, 5, 9), create a section with:**
   - Gate name and number as heading (e.g., "## Gate 1: The 5 Whys of Utility")
   - Reference link: "**Full specification:** `config/gates-full.md#gate-1`"
   - **Quick evaluation:** 2-4 bullet points on what to focus on for quick mode
   - **Pass in quick mode:** Brief criteria (1-2 lines)
   - **Fail in quick mode:** Brief criteria (1-2 lines)
   - **Template variables:** Note that same variables as full mode are used

5. **Template Variable Summary section:**
   - Note that quick mode uses same variables as full mode for its 5 gates
   - List quick mode specific variables:
     - `quick_score` - Score out of 5 (e.g., "4/5")
     - `triage_recommendation` - PROCEED/PROMISING/BORDERLINE/STOP
     - `recommendation_text` - Detailed next steps text
     - `next_steps` - Bulleted action items

6. **See Also section:**
   - Reference to config/gates-full.md
   - Reference to templates/audit-report-quick.md
   - Reference to guides/GATE-EXAMPLES.md

**Important:** Do NOT duplicate the full rubrics, scoring rules, or edge cases from gates-full.md. The quick mode guidance should be brief (focus on what's different for quick evaluation) and always reference the full spec.

Use the structure from 04-RESEARCH.md "Code Examples" section as a guide.

  <verify>
Read skill/config/gates-quick.md and confirm:
- File exists and is >100 lines
- Contains sections for exactly 5 gates (1, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Each gate has "Full specification:" reference to gates-full.md
- Triage algorithm table exists with 4 verdict levels
- Time target (5-10 minutes) is documented
- Template variables section exists
  </verify>
  <done>
gates-quick.md exists with reference-based 5-gate definitions, triage algorithm, and all quick mode guidance.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add time guidance and gut-check reminder</name>
  <files>skill/config/gates-quick.md</files>
  <action>
Add a prominent reminder at the top of the Quick Mode Overview section (after the overview table):

```markdown
> **Quick Mode Mindset**
>
> Target: 1-2 minutes per gate. If you're researching deeply, you're overthinking.
> Quick mode = gut check, not deep analysis. Save the rigor for full mode.
```

Also add guidance for when to use quick vs. full mode:

**Use quick mode when:**
- First-time audit of unfamiliar project
- Portfolio triage (evaluating multiple projects)
- Pre-audit sanity check before major investment
- Time-constrained (need answer in <10 minutes)

**Use full mode when:**
- Quick mode passed (5/5 or 4/5)
- Making go/no-go decision on significant investment
- Need complete documentation of all gates
- Project is already launched (comprehensive evaluation)
  </action>
  <verify>
Read skill/config/gates-quick.md and confirm:
- "Quick Mode Mindset" callout exists
- "Use quick mode when" list exists with 4 scenarios
- "Use full mode when" list exists with 4 scenarios
  </verify>
  <done>
gates-quick.md includes time guidance and clear direction on when to use quick vs. full mode.
  </done>
</task>

After completing both tasks:
1. Read full gates-quick.md
2. Count gate sections (should be exactly 5)
3. Verify each gate section references gates-full.md (grep for "gates-full.md")
4. Verify triage algorithm includes all 4 verdict levels
5. Verify file is concise (ideally <200 lines since it's reference-based, not duplicate)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- skill/config/gates-quick.md exists
- Contains exactly 5 gates (1, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Each gate references gates-full.md#gate-N
- Triage algorithm with PROCEED/PROMISING/BORDERLINE/STOP
- Time target documented (5-10 min total)
- Usage guidance for quick vs. full mode
- File is reference-based (no duplicated rubrics)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-quick-audit-mode/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
