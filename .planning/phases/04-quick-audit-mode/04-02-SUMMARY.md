# Phase 04 Plan 02: Quick Mode Interface Summary

**One-liner:** SKILL.md now detects --quick flag and routes to gates-quick.md/audit-report-quick.md for 5-gate triage audits.

## What Was Built

### 1. Quick Mode Usage Documentation
- Added `[--quick]` flag to usage syntax in SKILL.md
- Created Mode Selection table comparing Full (11 gates, 45-90 min) vs Quick (5 gates, 5-10 min)
- Referenced both config files (gates-full.md, gates-quick.md) and templates

### 2. Mode Detection in Process
- Added step 2 "Select mode" with --quick flag detection logic
- Updated step 6 to differentiate full mode recommendations vs quick mode triage
- Updated step 7 to reference both templates based on selected mode
- Renumbered subsequent steps (3-7) to accommodate mode selection

### 3. Quick Report Template
- Created `templates/audit-report-quick.md` with abbreviated 5-gate structure
- Header shows "Quick Triage (5 gates)" mode indicator
- Quick Score with triage_recommendation (PROCEED/PROMISING/BORDERLINE/STOP)
- Gate sections for 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 only (condensed output with key fields)
- Quick Scorecard table for at-a-glance results
- Next Steps section for actionable guidance
- Note explaining how to run full audit
- Footer indicating `/rfu-audit --quick` generation

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Task Breakdown

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Update SKILL.md Usage with --quick flag | c436856 | skill/SKILL.md |
| 2 | Update SKILL.md Process for mode awareness | c47c7f7 | skill/SKILL.md |
| 3 | Create audit-report-quick.md template | 02578eb | skill/templates/audit-report-quick.md |

**Total:** 3 tasks, 3 commits, ~2 minutes

## Decisions Made

### 1. Mode detection via flag presence
**Decision:** Check for `--quick` flag in arguments, not environment variable or config file.
**Rationale:** Simple, explicit, consistent with standard CLI conventions. User intent is clear from command.
**Impact:** Implementation checks args array for "--quick" string.

### 2. Condensed gate output in quick template
**Decision:** Show only key fields per gate (bedrock_need, time_total, bartender_sentence, wallet_self, occam_simpler).
**Rationale:** Quick mode is triage. Users need verdict and core evidence, not full detail.
**Impact:** Quick template is 93 lines vs 226 lines for full template. Focused on speed.

### 3. No Priority Fixes section in quick template
**Decision:** Quick template has only "Next Steps" with triage recommendation, not "Critical/Important/Nice" fixes.
**Rationale:** Quick mode doesn't generate prioritized fix lists - it tells you whether to run full audit or stop.
**Impact:** Clear difference in output purpose: full = action plan, quick = go/no-go decision.

### 4. Footer indicates quick mode
**Decision:** Quick template footer says "Generated by `/rfu-audit --quick`" instead of just `/rfu-audit`.
**Rationale:** Users need to know which mode generated report, especially when comparing reports.
**Impact:** Clear provenance for shared reports.

## Key Artifacts

### skill/SKILL.md (modified)
- Usage section now shows `[--quick]` flag with Mode Selection table
- Process section includes step 2 "Select mode" with config/template routing
- Documents 5-10 minute quick mode vs 45-90 minute full mode

### skill/templates/audit-report-quick.md (created)
- Abbreviated 5-gate template (1, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Quick Score header with triage recommendation
- Condensed gate sections (key fields only)
- Quick Scorecard table
- Note about running full audit
- Footer indicates --quick mode

## Integration Points

### Links FROM this plan
- SKILL.md Usage → config/gates-quick.md (mode selection reference)
- SKILL.md Usage → templates/audit-report-quick.md (template reference)
- SKILL.md Process → config/gates-quick.md (mode selection)
- SKILL.md Process → templates/audit-report-quick.md (output generation)

### Links TO this plan
- 04-01 (gates-quick.md defines 5-gate subset and triage thresholds)

### Links FORWARD
- 05-01 (audit execution needs to implement mode detection and template selection)
- Future mode-aware features (e.g., --quick-v2 with different gate subset)

## Verification Results

All verification checks passed:
- ✓ SKILL.md Usage shows --quick flag in syntax
- ✓ SKILL.md Usage has Mode Selection table with both modes
- ✓ SKILL.md Process includes step 2 "Select mode"
- ✓ SKILL.md Process step 7 references both templates
- ✓ templates/audit-report-quick.md exists
- ✓ Quick template has exactly 5 gates (1, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- ✓ Quick template has Quick Score with triage_recommendation
- ✓ Quick template has Quick Scorecard table
- ✓ Quick template has Next Steps section
- ✓ Quick template has note about full audit
- ✓ Quick template footer indicates --quick mode
- ✓ Quick template notably shorter (93 vs 226 lines)
- ✓ All template variables match gates-quick.md documentation

## Success Criteria

- [x] SKILL.md Usage shows --quick flag with mode table
- [x] SKILL.md Process includes mode detection step
- [x] templates/audit-report-quick.md exists
- [x] Quick template has 5 gates only (1, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- [x] Quick template has triage recommendation variables
- [x] Quick template notes how to run full audit
- [x] Quick template is notably shorter than full template

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 04 complete.** Both plans executed:
- 04-01: Quick mode gate config (gates-quick.md with 5-gate subset and triage thresholds)
- 04-02: Quick mode interface (SKILL.md mode detection and audit-report-quick.md template)

**Ready for Phase 05 (Comprehensive Documentation):**
- Gate examples guide (GATE-EXAMPLES.md)
- Quick mode guide (QUICK-MODE.md)

**Blockers:** None

**Notes:**
- Quick mode infrastructure complete and documented
- Implementation (Phase 05+) will need to check for --quick flag and route accordingly
- Template variables documented in gates-quick.md match quick template exactly
