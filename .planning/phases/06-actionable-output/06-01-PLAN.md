<objective>
Create the PRIORITY-MATRIX.md guide that documents how Claude should rank failed gates, estimate effort, and link resources.

Purpose: Codifies the priority matrix algorithm so Claude consistently generates actionable fix recommendations across all audits.

Output: `skill/guides/PRIORITY-MATRIX.md` with complete specification for priority ranking, effort estimation, resource linking, and tiered display.

  <name>Task 1: Create PRIORITY-MATRIX.md guide</name>
  <files>skill/guides/PRIORITY-MATRIX.md</files>
  <action>
Create `skill/guides/PRIORITY-MATRIX.md` with the following structure:

**1. Overview section:**
- Purpose: Transform failed gates into prioritized action plan
- When to use: After scoring all gates, before generating report
- Applies to both full and quick audit modes

**2. Priority Ranking Algorithm:**
- Impact-effort matrix approach (HIGH impact + LOW effort = quick wins first)
- Ranking order:
  1. HIGH impact + quick effort
  2. HIGH impact + medium/involved effort
  3. MEDIUM impact + quick effort
  4. Everything else
- Handle dependencies: if Gate X requires Gate Y first, Gate Y ranks higher
- Dependency notation: "Fix Gate Y before Gate X (dependency)"

**3. Gate-Specific Effort Defaults table:**

| Gate | Default Effort | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | medium | Rethinking positioning requires analysis |
| 2 | involved | Often needs new unique value |
| 3 | medium | Installation/UX improvements vary |
| 4 | quick | Text rewrite in README |
| 5 | medium | Requires validation with real people |
| 6 | medium | Statement refinement needs thought |
| 7 | medium | Varies by friction source (can be quick or involved) |
| 8 | medium | Often architectural considerations |
| 9 | involved | Removing features is hard |
| 10 | medium | Feature focus requires decisions |
| 11 | involved | Fundamental commitment question |

**4. Effort Override Rules:**
Document when to override defaults based on specific findings:
- Gate 4: If entire value proposition is wrong -> medium (not quick)
- Gate 7: If only documentation issue -> quick; if architecture -> involved
- Gate 9: If just removing unused features -> medium; if core restructuring -> involved

**5. Impact Assessment:**
- HIGH: Affects core viability (Gates 1, 5, 11)
- HIGH: First impression / adoption barrier (Gates 3, 4, 7)
- MEDIUM: Quality of experience (Gates 2, 6, 8)
- MEDIUM: Optimization (Gates 9, 10)

**6. Resource Linking Reference:**
Create table mapping each gate to available resources:

| Gate | Internal Resources | Skill Invocation | External/Fallback |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md | /wisdom-clarify | "Continue 5 Whys until reaching bedrock" |
| 2 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md | /wisdom-stoic-premeditation | "Articulate specific switching costs" |
| 3 | EDGE-CASES.md | - | "Docker Compose quickstart pattern" |
| 4 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md (lines 206-276) | - | "Rewrite first line as outcome, not implementation" |
| 5 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md | - | "Talk to 5 potential users this week" |
| 6 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md | - | "JTBD interview framework" |
| 7 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md, INPUT-VALIDATION.md | /prep-repo | "Friction audit walkthrough" |
| 8 | EDGE-CASES.md | /taches-cc-resources:consider:second-order | "Map consequences before/after" |
| 9 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md | /taches-cc-resources:consider:occams-razor | "Feature necessity audit" |
| 10 | GATE-EXAMPLES.md | /taches-cc-resources:consider:pareto | "80/20 feature analysis" |
| 11 | EDGE-CASES.md | - | "Commitment signal inventory" |

**7. Tiered Display Format:**
- Top Priority Fixes (detailed): Top 3 ranked gates with full context
  - Each includes: Issue, Why fix this first, Fix action, Resources
- Other Failed Gates (compact): Remaining failures as one-liners
  - Format: Gate Name - Effort: level - one-line issue
- Recommended (borderline): Gates that passed but are close to failing
  - Only include if borderline evidence exists

**8. Dependency Arrow Notation:**
- Unlocks: "Fixing this helps with Gate X" (when fix enables other fixes)
- Blocked by: "Must fix Gate Y first" (when gate depends on another)

**9. All-Pass Report Handling:**
- Check for borderline gates
- If borderline exists: Show as "Recommended Optimizations"
- If no borderline: Minimal congratulations, no empty sections

**10. Quick Mode Specifics:**
- Same format, just fewer gates (5 instead of 11)
- Priority matrix still applies to failed quick-mode gates
- Resources still linked inline
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at `skill/guides/PRIORITY-MATRIX.md`
- Contains all 10 sections listed above
- Gate-specific effort defaults table has all 11 gates
- Resource linking table has all 11 gates
- Tiered display format is clearly documented
  </verify>
  <done>
Complete guide for priority matrix generation exists. Claude can follow this guide to consistently rank failed gates, estimate effort, and link resources in any audit report.
