# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 1-7
**Total Plans:** 16

## Overview

This milestone transformed the RFU Audit skill from a working-but-inconsistent framework into a production-quality tool that produces consistent scores and actionable output. The journey started with modularizing the architecture (Phase 1), established scoring consistency through rubrics and examples (Phase 2), added input robustness (Phase 3), reduced friction with quick and auto-analyze modes (Phases 4-5), culminated in actionable output with priority matrices and fix integration (Phase 6), and added audit history tracking for improvement visualization (Phase 7).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Modular Architecture

**Goal**: Skill structure supports incremental enhancement without monolithic file edits
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create directory structure and migrate gate definitions to config/gates-full.md
- [x] 01-02: Update SKILL.md as orchestrator with file references

**Details:**
- Reduced SKILL.md from 282 to 93 lines (67% reduction)
- Established modular structure: config/, guides/, templates/, reference/
- Gate definitions externalized to config/gates-full.md (378 lines)

### Phase 2: Gate Clarity

**Goal**: Two auditors score the same project within 1 point of each other
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (modular structure enables targeted edits)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Add objective rubrics and FAIL examples for Gates 1-4
- [x] 02-02: Add objective rubrics and FAIL examples for Gates 5-8 (esp. Gate 5 Wallet)
- [x] 02-03: Add objective rubrics and FAIL examples for Gates 9-11 (esp. Gates 10, 11)
- [x] 02-04: Create edge case resolution guide with decision trees

**Details:**
- Added 25 FAIL examples showing what failure looks like
- Created 27 edge case resolution rules
- Transformed Gates 5, 10, 11 from subjective to objective scoring
- Gate 5: 4 signals, 3+ required to pass
- Gate 10: K/N ≤ 0.30 concentration ratio
- Gate 11: 6 commitment signals, 5+ required

### Phase 3: Input Validation

**Goal**: Clear error messages for bad input instead of cryptic failures
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (validation patterns go in guides/)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Add input validation section to SKILL.md with 6-stage validation flow
- [x] 03-02: Create INPUT-VALIDATION.md guide with complete error handling patterns

**Details:**
- 6-stage validation flow: normalize → exists → is-dir → README → project indicators → proceed
- 5 specific error message templates with actionable fix guidance
- Validation as step 0 before any audit work

### Phase 4: Quick Audit Mode

**Goal**: Filter projects in 5-10 minutes before committing to full audit
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (quick mode needs clear gate criteria)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Create gates-quick.md with 5-gate subset and triage algorithm
- [x] 04-02: Add quick mode to SKILL.md and create quick report template

**Details:**
- 5-gate critical path: Gates 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- 4-level triage: PROCEED / PROMISING / BORDERLINE / STOP
- Quick template (93 lines vs 226 for full)
- `--quick` flag detection in SKILL.md

### Phase 5: Auto-Analyze Mode

**Goal**: Reduce manual data entry by extracting project info automatically
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (auto-analyze needs well-defined gates)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Create AUTO-ANALYZE.md guide with extraction heuristics and verification workflow
- [x] 05-02: Add auto-analyze mode to SKILL.md with --auto-analyze flag

**Details:**
- 7-field extraction from README/package.json
- Confidence scoring for extracted data
- Human verification workflow required before scoring
- Composable with quick mode: `--quick --auto-analyze`

### Phase 6: Actionable Output

**Goal**: Failed audits tell you exactly what to fix and how
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (priority matrix needs stable gate definitions)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Create PRIORITY-MATRIX.md guide with ranking algorithm and effort estimation
- [x] 06-02: Update audit templates with Priority Matrix section and SKILL.md process
- [x] 06-03: Create TEMPLATE-SPEC.md documenting all template variables

**Details:**
- Impact-effort priority matrix ranking
- HIGH impact: Gates 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11
- Effort estimates: Quick / Medium / Involved
- Resource linking to fix skills/tools
- 98 template variables documented

### Phase 7: Audit History

**Goal**: Track project improvement over time
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (stable output format before adding history)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Create AUDIT-HISTORY.md guide and add history functionality to SKILL.md
- [x] 07-02: Update templates with frontmatter and delta display, document in TEMPLATE-SPEC.md

**Details:**
- File-based history in `.planning/audits/{project-name}/{mode}/`
- YAML frontmatter for machine-readable metadata
- Delta indicators: ↑ improved, ↓ regressed, = unchanged
- Per-gate change tracking in scorecard
- `--history` flag for timeline view

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Single gates-full.md vs separate files | Easier to search, gates are related concepts |
| 5-gate quick mode subset (1, 3, 4, 5, 9) | Critical path for viability testing |
| Gate 5 multi-signal validation (4 signals, 3+ required) | Converts subjective "honest yes" into countable evidence |
| Gate 10 concentration ratio (K/N ≤ 0.30) | Replaces subjective "concentrated value" with math |
| Gate 11 commitment signals (5 of 6) | Observable evidence instead of "would regret NOT shipping" |
| Impact-effort priority matrix | HIGH impact gates prioritized: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11 |
| File-based history storage | Skill remains stateless; history in .planning/audits/ |

**Issues Resolved:**
- Subjective scoring → Objective rubrics with thresholds
- No failure examples → 25 FAIL examples across all gates
- Cryptic errors → 6-stage validation with actionable messages
- Slow audits → 5-gate quick mode (5-10 min)
- Manual data entry → Auto-analyze extraction
- "What failed" → "What to fix first" priority matrix
- Point-in-time → Historical comparison with deltas

**Issues Deferred:**
- Multi-user/team auditing → v2 (complexity outweighs value)
- Competitor database for Gate 2 → v2 (requires maintenance)
- Partial completion (save/resume) → v2 (nice-to-have)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
