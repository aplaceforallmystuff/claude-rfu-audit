## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 01-01 | Single gates-full.md vs. separate files per gate | Easier to search, gates are related concepts, file manageable at 378 lines | Affects how gate content is organized and referenced |
| 01-01 | Template variables co-located with gate definitions | Reduces cognitive load during audit execution | Affects report generation implementation |
| 01-01 | Placeholder guide files with "Status: Placeholder" marker | Establishes structure now, enables parallel development | Affects content development workflow |
