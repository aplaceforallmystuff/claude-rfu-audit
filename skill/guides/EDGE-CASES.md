## Gate 5: The Wallet Test

### Edge Case: Open Source Projects

- TBD: When multiple features are required for platform coherence?

### Edge Case: MVP vs. Feature-Complete
- TBD: Distinguishing between "not yet built" and "unnecessarily complex"?

### Edge Case: Regulatory Requirements

## Gate 11: Regret Minimization

### Edge Case: Market Timing
- TBD: When the idea is right but timing is wrong?

### Edge Case: Learning Projects
- TBD: When building to learn vs. building to ship?

### Edge Case: Passion vs. Pragmatism
- TBD: When you love it but market doesn't care?

## General Edge Cases

### Multi-Purpose Tools
- TBD: How to score when project serves multiple distinct use cases?
